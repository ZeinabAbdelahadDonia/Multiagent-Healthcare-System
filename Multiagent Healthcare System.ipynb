There is no significant rotation.\\n\\n**Bones:**\\n\\n*   The bony structures, including the ribs, clavicles, scapulae (portions visualized), and thoracic vertebrae appear intact without obvious fractures, dislocations, or destructive lesions.\\n*   No gross abnormalities of bone density are appreciated.\\n\\n**Soft Tissues:**\\n\\n*   The soft tissues of the chest wall appear unremarkable.\\n*   There is no evidence of subcutaneous air (emphysema).\\n*   The hila appear normal in size and position.\\n\\n**Lungs:**\\n\\n*   The lungs are clear bilaterally. There are no focal areas of consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.\\n*   The lung markings are normal in distribution and density.\\n\\n**Heart and Mediastinum:**\\n\\n*   The heart size appears to be within normal limits.\\n*   The mediastinal contours appear normal, and there is no evidence of mediastinal widening.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\n*   The chest X-ray is within normal limits. There are no acute findings to report.\\n\\n**Disclaimer:**\\n\\nThis is an interpretation based solely on the provided X-ray image.

      "OBJECTIVES: To monitor the safety and utilisation of AZD1222 under real-world use in the UK.\n",
      "DESIGN: A non-interventional post-authorisation active surveillance study.\n",
      "SETTING: Vaccination sites in the UK.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 17 945 participants were eligible and provided consent to participate in the study between 1 March 2021 and 6 April 2023. Participants were followed up at weeks 1, 4 and 14 and at months 6, 9, 12 and 18 after the first dose of AZD1222 vaccination and prompted to complete electronic data capture forms. A total of 11 219 participants submitted a Follow-Up 1 form and 5189 participants submitted a Follow-Up 7 form (at 18 months).\n",
      "PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The safety of AZD1222, including the identification, assessment and quantification of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI), was examined. The utilisation of AZD1222 was described and characterised, including populations with missing information.\n",
      "RESULTS: The majority of participants were women (n=10 845; 60.4%) and the median age (IQR) was 50 (43, 62) years. Most participants were from white ethnic groups (n=13 112; 73.1%). Headache and fatigue had the highest reported incidence rate (421.28 cases per 1000 person years and 386.00 cases per 1000 person years, respectively). The most frequently reported AESI was anosmia (6.25 cases per 1000 person years). An increased Observed versus Expected (O:E) ratio was seen for anaphylaxis (O:E 7.38 (95% CI 2.80 to 11.95); based on 10 observed cases (expected cases: 1.36)) and anosmia and/or ageusia (O:E 39.23 (95% CI 29.13 to 49.32), based on 58 observed cases (expected cases: \u001b[0m\n",

Roflumilast:\\n\\t* Use roflumilast 250mcg twice daily for patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease.\\n\\n**Other Medications:**\\n\\nIf cardiovascular issues are suspected, consider adding:\\n\\n1. **Beta-Blocker:** Metoprolol or atenolol to manage angina symptoms.\\n2. **Antihypertensive Agent:** Lisinopril or losartan to control blood pressure.\\n\\n**Monitoring and Follow-up:**\\n\\nRegular monitoring and follow-up with the healthcare professional are essential:\\n\\n1. **Frequency of Medication Administration:** Schedule regular appointments to assess medication efficacy, adjust dosages as needed, and monitor for side effects.\\n2. **Blood Work and Lab Tests:** Regularly check for signs of fluid retention (e.g., swelling in ankles), kidney function, blood pressure, and other potential comorbidities.\\n\\n**Patient Education:**\\n\\nTo ensure the patient's safety and adherence to treatment:\\n\\n1. **Regular Medication Reminders:** Provide patients with a medication schedule or calendar to help them stay on track.\\n2. **Symptom Management:** Educate patients on recognizing and reporting symptoms related to their condition, such as shortness of breath, coughing, or chest pain.\\n\\n**Severity Assessment:**\\n\\nThe severity of the patient's symptoms should be reassessed regularly to determine if adjustments are necessary in the treatment plan.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, healthcare professionals can work with patients to develop an effective treatment plan that addresses their respiratory and potential cardiovascular issues.\"},\n",

       " 'evaluation': {'content': \"**Evaluation:**\\n\\nThe provided medical diagnosis is a comprehensive review of the patient's symptoms, possible conditions, severity assessment, recommendations, medication advice, and monitoring plan.\\n\\n**Completeness (80/100):**\\n\\nThe diagnosis covers most reported symptoms, including shortness of breath, occasional coughing, swelling in ankles, and potential cardiovascular issues. However, there are some gaps in the analysis, such as:\\n\\n1. **Age and Medical History:** The patient's age and medical history are not explicitly mentioned, which may impact the diagnosis.\\n2. **Symptom Onset and Progression:** There is limited information about the onset and progression of symptoms, which could provide valuable insights for diagnosis.\\n3. **Physical Examination Findings:** No physical examination findings are reported, making it challenging to determine the severity of the patient's condition.\\n\\n**Severity Assessment (70/100):**\\n\\nThe severity assessment is mostly adequate, but there are some areas that require improvement:\\n\\n1. **Subjective Symptoms:** The patient's subjective symptoms, such as shortness of breath and coughing, may not accurately reflect their actual severity.\\n2. **Objective Measures:** No objective measures, such as vital signs or laboratory results, are reported to support the severity assessment.\\n\\n**Recommendations (85/100):**\\n\\nThe recommendations are comprehensive and cover most aspects of patient care. However:\\n\\n1. **Consultation with Healthcare Professional:** The recommendation to schedule an appointment with a healthcare professional is necessary, but it would be more effective if the patient's symptoms and medical history were discussed during the consultation.\\n2. **Diagnostic Tests:** The recommended diagnostic tests, such as blood work, imaging studies, and pulmonary function tests, are essential for confirming the diagnosis.\\n\\n**Medication Advice (80/100):**\\n\\nThe medication advice is mostly adequate, but there are some areas that require improvement:\\n\\n1. **Combination Therapy:** The combination of albuterol and fluticasone is suitable for managing asthma or COPD, but it would be more effective if the patient's inhaler technique was demonstrated.\\n2. **Steroid-Sparing Agent:** The use of prednisone should be carefully monitored due to potential side effects and interactions with other medications.\\n\\n**Monitoring and Follow-up (85/100):**\\n\\nThe monitoring and follow-up plan is comprehensive, covering regular medication administration, blood work, laboratory results, and patient education.\\n\\n**Patient Education (80/100):**\\n\\nThe patient education section is adequate, but it would be more effective if the patient's symptoms were explained in a clear and concise manner.\\n\\n**Overall Evaluation:**\\n\\nThe provided medical diagnosis is mostly comprehensive and thorough. However, there are some areas that require improvement, such as:\\n\\n1. **Subjective Symptoms:** The patient's subjective symptoms should be discussed during the consultation with a healthcare professional.\\n2. **Objective Measures:** Objective measures, such as vital signs or laboratory results, should be reported to support the severity assessment.\\n3. **Combination Therapy:** The combination of medications should be demonstrated to ensure proper inhaler technique.\\n4. **Steroid-Sparing Agent:** The use of prednisone should be carefully monitored due to potential side effects and interactions with other medications.\\n\\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\\n\\n1. **Consultation with Healthcare Professional:** Schedule a consultation with a healthcare professional to discuss the patient's symptoms, medical history, and test results.\\n2. **Diagnostic Tests:** Order diagnostic tests, such as blood work, imaging studies, and pulmonary function tests, to confirm the diagnosis.\\n3. **Combination Therapy:** Demonstrate the combination of medications and ensure proper inhaler technique.\\n4. **Steroid-Sparing Agent:** Carefully monitor the use of prednisone due to potential side effects and interactions with other medications.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas for improvement, healthcare professionals can provide more comprehensive and effective care for patients with respiratory issues.\",\n",
